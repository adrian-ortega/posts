# About Me

Hello, my name is Adrian Ortega.

I'm an experienced web developer, father of three beautiful children, an artist, music lover, and all-around goof.

Over my lifetime I've been a mechanic, driven a tow truck, run a t-shirt and sticker business, became a graphic designer, and finally a web developer.

After many years of "being at it" and working for different companies in the industry, being part of teams (and running them), I've honed my craft as a web application developer. I work primarily with JavaScript (Vue, React, Node) and PHP. Other than software languages, I am a native Spanish speaker and love working with my hands!!
