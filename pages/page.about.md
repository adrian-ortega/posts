# Adrian Ortega – Developer, Creator, Goofball

Hello, my name is Adrian Ortega.

I'm a seasoned web developer, a father to three amazing kids, an artist, a music enthusiast, and an all-around goof.

My journey has been anything but ordinary. I've been a mechanic, driven a tow truck, run a t-shirt and sticker business, worked as a graphic designer, and eventually found my true passion in web development.

After years of honing my craft—working for various companies, being part of teams, and leading them—I’ve become a well-rounded web application developer. I specialize in JavaScript (Vue, React, Node) and PHP, but beyond code, I’m a hands-on creator who loves building things, solving problems, and collaborating with great people.

Oh, and I’m a native Spanish speaker—so whether it’s coding or conversation, I’m fluent in multiple languages.
