## I love the tilt!

One of the coolest things about working at a place that has like minded people that not only get along well but actually enjoy working with each other is that the hi-jinks carry over even when you get home from a long day at work.

I think the past three months at GoldenComm have been great. But every day that I’ve been at this new company has literally been hustle and code. Long days don’t end at the office. There have been many a night that I’ve been super tired but still continuing on projects that I know need to be finished. Knowing that someone else besides my own ego is depending on the completion of said projects pushes me through the night.

Tonight is one of those nights. I decide that while working on a soon-to-launch site, I can take a break and peruse Facebook. I find that my coworkers are all winding down from an equally long day. A simple gesture of saying cheers to one of them turns into an awesome beer-ception photograph.

I’ve said it in another post, I like my job. I like the people I work with. I don’t see me leaving anytime soon.
